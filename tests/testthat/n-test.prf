# Test inspired by orthography of the Witotoan language ... as used in ...

# The problem in this orthography is that the character "n" has two different interpretations
# when used between vowels, then the "n" is a separate phoneme (alveolar nasal)
# when used after a vowel, but before a consonant, than the "n" signifies nasalisation of the preceding vowel
# This is codified here by specifying a tailored grapheme cluster "an"
# However, this cluster has to be ignored when a vowel follows, as specified in the rules file.
